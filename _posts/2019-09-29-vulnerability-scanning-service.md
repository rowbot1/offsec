<p>Hi, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am developing my cyber security
skills and am happy to offer small or medium businesses a vulnerability scan.
This will give you some peace of mind to know what your business is exposing
online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Including: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• A test if your business is leaking
information about your servers which an attacker could use to gain access to
your network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• A check to review what documents
can be found on your domain – to ensure you’re not revealing sensitive
documents. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Check email address passwords have
not been leaked online</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Graph of website entities, like
mail servers, subdomains etc, giving you a map of what is exposed</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Vulnerability assessment report </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will get a PDF report on your
website/IP address. All information will be treated with sensitivity. </p>
