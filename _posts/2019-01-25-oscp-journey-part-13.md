<p>We'll I'm back in the labs after a few months off. I took a good 2 months off hacking and the last month I subscribed to <a href="http://virtualhackinglabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtualhackinglabs.com (opens in a new tab)">virtualhackinglabs.com</a> for one month. Their PDF is very good.</p>

<p>In my time off I have been improving my notes <a href="http:// guide.offsecnewbie.com">guide.offsecnewbie.com.</a> I did a few hackthebox machines and worked on <a href="https://guide.offsecnewbie.com/kali-configuration/terminator-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="customising my terminal (opens in a new tab)">customising my terminal</a> to make some things easier.</p>

<p>In my previous attempt I skimmed over the exercises. This time I'm ensuring I do them all and understand them - as best I can. </p>

<p>I put off the Buffer Overflow exercises last time as I couldn't get my head around it. This time - as of last night I completed the SLmail and the VulnServer exercises! Very chuffed with myself! I took a day off work and put in about 12 hours to make notes on it and complete the exercises. </p>

<p>Reading over the notes I had taken for the boxes that I had rooted has revealed that my notes are terrible! If I was to submit a lab report or exam report the way I had taken notes I would have not have passed! An important lesson learned there.</p>

<p>I'm on the OSCP and VHL discord groups so feel free to drop me a message if you want to bounce some ideas off of me. Be aware that my time zone is UK so I'd appreciate no messages at 3am </p>
