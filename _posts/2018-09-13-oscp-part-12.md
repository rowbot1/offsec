<p>Well I've just finished the exam and unsurprisingly I've failed. I didn't exploit a single box. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now for the excuses:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main one is my lack of knowledge - simply down to the fact that I needed to put in more time that I could. Now no doubt some people would be able to pass with the time I put in but not me - thus the title of this site, I'm very much a newb. </p>

<p>I was working late on the labs two nights before the exam, the night before I got to bed at a reasonable time but got essentially no sleep. A random event occured, cows from two fields across broke into my garden and wrecked the place! I tried to chase them but they were having none of it. I was equiped to deal with dirty cow exploits but not real cows! Then during my exam I had to find out who owned them and then had the farmers coming round and trying not to accept blame and not wanting to pay for damages. I now have a "garden" full of crap and piss! Looks like the BBQ this weekend is cancelled.</p>

<p>With all that going on perhaps my mind wasn't in the right place. Saying that I have to be realistic - I would not have passed anyway, but I'd like to think I would have got into a box or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This attempt allowed me to get experience of the exam so when I'm in a position to pass (knowledge wise) I will know what to expect. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had made a plan which I stuck to and it made me feel as if I had quite a lot of time and good amount of breaks. <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AoBJLD90xdyFg6pJr88YtfR-Q5XjMQ">OSCP exam plan</a>. Let me know if you use it any find it useful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So my exam was a proctored exam and I found it fine on average, about 15 minutes before your starting time you connect to:<br/><a href="https://screenconnect.offensive-security.com:8040/">https://screenconnect.offensive-security.com:8040/</a><br/>to share your screen<br/><a href="https://webcam.offensive-security.com/">https://webcam.offensive-security.com/</a><br/>to view you and do a room scan<br/>You also have to show your ID and compare that to your face.<br/><br/>The only issue I had was I bought a webcam from Amazon Logitech C270 HD Webcam and it was terrible at viewing text - I spent about 30 minutes trying to get it to focus on my ID. In the end I had to get my laptop and use its webcam to focus on it. Make sure you test this before your exam.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's next?<br/>When I first purchased lab access I paid for two 3 month access. So before I start my second stint in the labs I'm gonna take a break for a month maybe two. In slow time I'm going to go through and spruce up my exercises report format. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll tackle a couple of hack the box machines and maybe a vulnhub machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have passed let me know your secret.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will achieve this certification I don't care how many resits it takes. <br/><br/></p>
