<p>Well less that a week until my exam and I'm not feeling confident. I was hoping for at least 20 boxes owned but the rabbit holes owned me.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've signed up for the proctored exam, meaning someone will be watching me via a webcam for the duration of the exam. Bad news for them, I can only hack when naked. </p>

<p>I just haven't put the time required to pass the exam in so failure is inevitable. This is okay I've still learned a lot. I've signed up for another 3 months labs which I'll start in a few months + I'll use the credits for being on the pilot to pay for more exam resits. I'll take a break from OSCP for a while and concentrate on HTB actually looking forward to that!</p>

<p>Privilege escalation is my weak area. I've decided to list all the ways I know of to PE. Let me know if you know any more.</p>
