So have been working away at hackthebox machines for about 9 months now and thoroughly enjoying them. They really have allowed me to build up my skill set and the people there are polite and funny. I'm pleased to say I've graduated from Noob to Script Kiddie and currently 50% of the way to Hackthebox Hacker status (there still are quite a few levels higher).

When I started, I had an Off Sec Chrome bookmark with about 5 sites. Now that bookmark takes some time to scroll through. Its amazing the amount of great info there is out there. I really should sort them but I kinda know where things are now so I might just leave it. I sometimes wish I was Jonny Five...INPUT....INPUT instead of a 'rowbot' that requires a 28k modem to assimilate information and even then, has constant disconnections.

I'm about to start the infamous OSCP, signed up for 3 months and have been toying with the idea of having regular blogs throughout it, more for me to look back at my mind set and what I was struggling with, let me know what you think. I am excited and apprehensive. I have come to the conclusion that the more you know the more you realize how much you don't know! Especially watching Ippsec and r00k's Youtube Videos. Highly recommended.

I'm anticipating a real kick in the stomach when they bombard me with PDFs and videos. But as this blog states Offensive Security is a journey and no journey can be started without the first step. What I've now come to accept is that OSCP is only the first step....but f**k me its a big one.
