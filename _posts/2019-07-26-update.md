<p>Hey guys haven't done much lately due to
life...or rather the new life that has appeared. I’m taking the paternity leave
as my work gives me 6 months full pay – so financially it makes sense me taking
the time off work. </p>

<p>Now I know what you’re thinking that I’ll be
able to be home and hack. Yes, I’m home but unfortunately, I haven’t had much
of a chance. The wee guy only sleeps for about 20-30 mins at a time during the
day so its hard to stop and start things.</p>

<p>In those short times I have been playing about
with learning Python and I found <a href="https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html">https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html</a>
which I’m working my way through. I have to say that having no programming
experience and looking though python exploits was gobbledegook. Now that I have
a very small level of python knowledge the exploits are not as confusing. </p>

<p>I have received a lot of
complements about my pentest notes <a href="http://guide.offsecnewbie.com">http://guide.offsecnewbie.com</a>.
So I’m really glad they have helped people. Feel free to drop me a message if
you spot mistakes or have some useful hacking tips, so I can add them to the notes.</p>

<p>Anyway I’m about on common
discord channels, feel free to message me about any issues you’re having with a
box as it can be good to talk through a problem with someone to help you get to
the answer.</p>
